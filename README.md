# systemDesign

This repository contains my notes and small projects related to system design.

## What's inside

- `notes/`: Markdown files covering important system design concepts.
- `projects/`: Small system design implementations like URL shortener, rate limiter, etc.

## Why this repo?

I'm learning system design to improve my understanding of how large-scale systems work â€” how they're structured, scaled, and made reliable.

This repo helps me keep everything organized in one place.

## Status

Work in progress. I'm updating it as I learn.
