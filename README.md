# Lecture 1 Notes

## 1. What is Low‑Level Design (LLD)?

**Definition:** Designing the internal structure (“skeleton”) of an application by identifying classes/objects, their relationships, data flows, and how DSA solutions plug into this structure.

- **DSA:** Solves isolated problems (e.g. “find shortest path in an array/graph”) using algorithms like binary search, quicksort, Dijkstra’s, heaps, etc.
- **LLD:** Determines which objects exist in the system and how they interact, then applies DSA inside that structure.

## 2. Illustrative Story: Two Approaches to Building “QuickRide”

**Scenario:** Build a ride‑booking app (“QuickRide”) like Uber/Ola.

### Anurag’s DSA‑First Approach:

1. **Problem decomposition:**
   - Map city intersections to graph nodes, roads to edges.
   - Use Dijkstra’s algorithm to compute shortest route.
   - Use a min‑heap (priority queue) to match riders to closest drivers.

2. **Gaps:**
   - No identification of classes/entities (User, Rider, Location, Notification, Payment).
   - Omits data security (masking phone numbers).
   - Missing integration points (notifications, payment gateways).
   - No consideration for scaling to millions of users.

### Maurya’s LLD‑First Approach:

1. **Entity identification:**
   - Objects: User, Rider, Location, NotificationService, PaymentGateway, etc.

2. **Define relationships & interactions:**
   - How User and Rider connect via Location.
   - How NotificationService and PaymentGateway integrate.

3. **Non‑functional concerns:**
   - Data security: Protect personal info.
   - Scalability: Architect code to handle millions of users without performance collapse.

4. **Then apply DSA:**
   - Embed shortest‑path algorithm and driver‑matching heap inside this object‑oriented framework.

## 3. Core LLD Principles & Focus Areas

1. **Scalability**
   - Handle large user volumes easily.
   - Code structure should allow rapid, low‑effort expansion (adding servers, features).

2. **Maintainability**
   - New features shouldn’t break existing ones.
   - Code should be easy to debug and locate bugs.

3. **Reusability**
   - Write loosely coupled, “plug‑and‑play” modules (e.g. generic notification or matching algorithms usable across apps like Zomato, Swiggy, Amazon delivery).

## 4. What LLD Is Not (vs. HLD)

- **High‑Level Design (HLD)** focuses on system architecture, not code structure:
  - **Tech stack:** Choice of languages/frameworks (e.g. Java Spring Boot).
  - **Database:** SQL vs. NoSQL vs. hybrid.
  - **Server scaling & deployment:** Autoscaling, load balancers, cost optimization on AWS/GCP.
  - **Cost considerations:** Minimizing cloud/server expenses per load.

## 5. Summary & Takeaways

- **DSA = Brain** of an application: algorithms solve specific tasks.
- **LLD = Skeleton:** object models, class diagrams, code organization, and where algorithms plug in.
- **HLD = Architecture:** system‑wide infrastructure, tech stack, databases, servers.

## 6. Key line to remember

> “If DSA is the brain, LLD is the skeleton of your application.”
